# About this repository

This project is my solution to [this](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI) challenge on the front end mentor website.

This project was built using ReactJS and JavaScript. The solution is not an exact match of the challenge described on the front end mentor website but an approximation.

The **design** folder contains screenshots of the design to be implemented.

The **interactive-rating-component** folder is the directory for the react app.
